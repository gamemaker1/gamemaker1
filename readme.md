### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Vedant! Thanks for reading!**

I'm a Linux and open source enthusiast. I love reading, programming and
documenting stuff.

I'm a co-maintainer of the package
[`express-rate-limit`](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit), and a
contributor to
[`refined-github`](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github),
[`dts-bundle-generator`](https://github.com/timocov/dts-bundle-generator) among
others. I simply love Node, Typescript, bash scripting and anything to do with
Linux (especially Arch Linux).

I would love to contribute to open source projects - feel free to
[reach out to me](https://github.com/gamemaker1/gamemaker1/discussions/1)!
