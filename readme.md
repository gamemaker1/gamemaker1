### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Vedant! Thanks for reading!**

I'm a 10th grader and a Linux and open source enthusiast. I love reading and programming.

Iâ€™m currently working on the [Dabbu Knowledge Platform](https://github.com/dabbu-knowledge-platform) - rethinking the way we organize and traverse large amounts of knowledge, no matter where it is stored!

I'm fluent in NodeJS, Kotlin, Java, Python, and Dart. I love bash scripting and anything to do with Linux (especially Arch). I'm currently learning Rust and C.

I love programming and open source and would love to contribute to open source projects - feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:gamemaker0042@gmail.com).

Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/gamemaker1/discussions/1)!
