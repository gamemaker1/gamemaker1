### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Vedant! Thanks for reading!**

I'm a 10th grader and a Linux and open source enthusiast. I love reading and programming.

I'm fluent in NodeJS, Kotlin, Java, Python, and Dart. I love bash and/or perl scripting and anything to do with Linux (especially Arch Linux). I'm currently learning Rust and C.

I love programming and open source and would love to contribute to open source projects - feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:gamemaker0042@gmail.com).

Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/gamemaker1/discussions/1)!
