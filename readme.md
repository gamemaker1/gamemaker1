### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Vedant! Thanks for reading!**

I'm a Linux and open source enthusiast. I love reading, programming and
documenting stuff.

I'm a co-maintainer of the package
[`express-rate-limit`](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit),
and a contributor to [`refined-github`](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github),
[`dts-bundle-generator`](https://github.com/timocov/dts-bundle-generator),
[`sunbird-rc`](https://github.com/sunbird-rc) and [`beckn`](https://github.com/beckn)
(among others).

I love Node, Typescript, bash scripting and anything to do with Linux (especially Arch
Linux). I'm also trying out Rust and Go and loving them so far.

I would love to contribute to open source projects - feel free to reach out to me via
email or [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/gamemaker1/discussions/1).
